                            --------

This example presently illustrates the following basic concepts, and in
particular (indicated with ***), how to use G4 for optical photon
generation and transport. 

 ==> define Random Number Engine and initial seed

G4VUserPhysicsList
------------------

 ==> define particles; including *** G4OpticalPhoton     ***
     define processes; including *** G4Cerenkov          ***
                                 *** G4Scintillation     ***
                                 *** G4OpAbsorption      ***
                                 *** G4OpRayleigh        ***
                                 *** G4OpBoundaryProcess ***

G4VUserDetectorConstruction
---------------------------

 ==> defined some experimental setups used during my PhD

G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction
-----------------------------

 ==> particles may be generated from freya or cgmf sampler or from geant4
 
G4UserRunAction
---------------

==> define G4Timer (start/stop)
    set verbose levels

G4UserStackingAction
--------------------

==> show how to count the number of secondary particles in an event

Visualisation
-------------
 
 The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 The initialisation of the drawing is done via a set of /vis/ commands
 in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from
 the main in case of interactive running mode.
 
 The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the tank.
 The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 
 HOW TO START
 ------------
 - Prerequisits:
     % Geant
     % LLNL FREYA libarries
     % armadillo library
     
 - compile and link to generate an executable
 	% cd foler
 	% mkdir workspace
     % cd workspace
     % cmake ../
     % make -j8
     
   This example handles the program arguments in a new way.
   It can be run with the following optional arguments:
     
     ./EXE [-option] [-geometry_select] [-spectrum_select]  [-particle_select]
     
     [-option]
        -m [file]    Passes the file name of the macro which contains
                     information on the number of histories to simulate.
                     If not included, the OpenGL GUI will be displayed
                     for geometry inspection.
        -r [val]     Sets the random number seed to [val] (optional).
        -t [val]     Sets the number of threads to be used (default = 1)
        -c [val]     Sets the threshold for the scintillation detectors13
                     to [val] which is expressed in keV (default = 200 keV)
     
     [-geometry_select]
         -assay       Selects the LSD mock-up assay.
         -lancs       Selects the REFL15 setup.
         -l           Selects the BARE15 setup. 
         !!!!If neither -lancs or -l flag is not used, BARE8 is used.
         -w [val]     Selects the radius of water filled cylinder used in20
                      neutron spectroscopy experiments. Only functional if
                      -assay and -lancs flags are not used
     [-spectrum_select]
          -mono        Sets the particle generator to use mono-energetic24               
                       particle beams with a directional vector of (0, 0, 1).
                       The energy is defined by the -n or -g flag.26   
          -AmLi        Sets the particle generator to use approximated AmLi27
                       neutron particle. 
           !!!!If neither [-spectrum_select] flag is used, FREYA generated Cf-252 29 spectrum is used
          -uncor       Produce uncorrelated angular distribution with FREYA
          -cmod [fname]get angular/energy and multiplicity distribution from binary file
     [-particle_select]
          -n [energy]  Selects neutron particles to be simulated. If -mono flag 
                       has been declared, then the neutron energy is set assay
                       [energy] keV. Otherwise only neutrons from FREYA Cf-25234
                       distribution is simulated.
          -g [energy]  Selects photon particles to be simulated. If -mono flag 
                       has been declared, then the photon energy is set assay
                       [energy] keV. Otherwise only photons from FREYA Cf-25238
                       distribution is simulated.
